To import from Google Drive or Dropbox, copy the link to the video file itself (not a folder) and set sharing to ‘Anyone with the link’. If an upload stops halfway, keep the app open on a steady connection and try again. If you see a message about your plan’s video limit, delete an old video or upgrade your plan. Still stuck? Email {mail} with the file name and size.</>,

If the AI picked the wrong moment or framing, drag the start and end of the clip on the timeline or move the crop box. Hooks, titles and hashtags are written by AI and can be wrong, so check and edit them before you post. Clips on the Free plan carry a Shortcut watermark, which paid plans remove.</>,

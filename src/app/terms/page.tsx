    title: 'Description of Service',
    body: <>Shortcut is a video editing service that turns your long videos into short vertical clips for platforms such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. It uses artificial intelligence to transcribe your videos, find the best moments, and write hooks, titles, captions and hashtags. AI can make mistakes, so always review your clips and text before you post them; we do not promise any number of views, followers or earnings. Each plan keeps your videos and clips for the history period shown on our pricing page, so please download any clips you want to keep. Features may change, be added or be removed over time.</>,

    title: 'Plans and Payments',
    body: <>Shortcut offers a free plan and paid plans. The price, limits and features of each plan are shown before you buy, and prices are in Indian Rupees (₹). Paid plans are subscriptions that renew automatically each month or year until you cancel, and you will be charged at the start of each new billing period. If you subscribe in our iOS or Android app, payment is charged to your Apple or Google account, and billing, renewals and refunds follow the App Store or Google Play terms; you can manage or cancel your subscription in your App Store or Google Play account settings at least 24 hours before it renews, and deleting the app does not cancel it. When you cancel, you keep paid features until the end of the period you have paid for. Apart from refunds required by law or by the store’s refund policy, payments are non-refundable. Clips made on the free plan carry a Shortcut watermark, which you must not remove. These terms are between you and us, not Apple or Google, who are not responsible for the service.</>,

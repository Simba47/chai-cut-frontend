    title: 'Information We Collect',
    body: <>We collect information you provide directly to us when you create an account, upload or import videos, edit clips, choose a plan, or request support. This includes your name, email address, password (stored only in hashed form), the videos and audio you upload, any images or logos you add, your edits, and your plan and usage details. When we process your videos we also create transcripts and AI results such as clip moments, hooks, titles, captions and hashtags, and our servers receive basic technical data such as your IP address and device and browser type. In our mobile apps, we ask for access to your photos, videos and files only so you can pick a video to upload and save finished clips. We do not collect your contacts, precise location, or social media account data. Shortcut is meant for people aged 18 and over, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.</>,

// the whole editor that often made the picture lag, so the store's currentTimeMs (what the editor
// redraws from) follows at most every STORE_EVERY_MS — the first change at once, the last one
// always. What has to move every frame (the playhead line, the time, the preview's overlays)
// reads the exact time from the live feed below instead (useLiveTimeMs, liveTime.get()).
// While playing the editor doesn't need it at all: everything that plays (the preview, the
// sound, the music, the playhead, the timeline's scrolling) follows the live feed, and the rest
// (which section the panels show as current) catches up when playing stops.
